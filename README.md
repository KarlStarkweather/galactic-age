# Galactic Age Calculator

## By Karl Starkweather
This project contains object methods to calculate ages on various planets (within our solar system) based on the rotational "year" of those planets. It also calculates life expectancy converted to those planetary years based on current US average life expectancy.

## Technologies used:
* Javascript
* Webpack
* Jest

## Setup Instructions
Clone directory from repository at https://github.com/KarlStarkweather/galactic-age
run tests located in _tests_/ using npm commands

## known bugs:
Because tests use fixed dates to calculate ages, they will begin to fail with the passage of time as expected values change
